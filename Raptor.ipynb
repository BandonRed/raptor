      "Answer:  Medicare determines the correct jurisdiction for a reassigned service claim based on specific guidelines outlined in the Program Integrity Manual. Providers and suppliers must bill the correct B/MAC (Medicare Administrative Contractor) for reassigned services, even if they were initially paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). Claims must be submitted to the B/MAC that has jurisdiction over the geographic area where the services were provided. Additionally, providers and suppliers must meet the current enrollment criteria specified in the Program Integrity Manual chapter 10 to bill for reassigned services. It is essential to submit claims to the appropriate A/B MACs for processing, especially if a healthcare provider operates in multiple localities or under multiple MACs for Part B services. Medicare follows specific rules and procedures to ensure that claims are processed correctly and efficiently, and misdirected claims are handled according to the specified guidelines.\n"

For example, for an MRA of the chest (CPT 71555), the corresponding C codes are C8909 – C8911.\\n\\nAdditionally, for claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2003, coverage under this benefit has been expanded for the use of MRA for diagnosing pathology in the renal or aortoiliac arteries. The HCPCS code to report this expanded coverage of MRA, such as MRA of the pelvis with or without contrast material(s) (CPT 72198), should be reported using the specific C codes C8918 - C8920 for hospitals subject to OPPS.\\n\\nTherefore, when billing for an MRI of the chest with contrast (CPT 70551) for the evaluation of a lung nodule (ICD R91.8) in a hospital outpatient setting, it is essential to follow the specific C code reporting requirements outlined in the Medicare Chapter 13 guidelines for MRA procedures.',\n",

According to the provided context, when submitting claims for MRI procedures, it is essential to follow the appropriate HCPCS codes for the specific imaging area. For MRI of the chest, the following HCPCS codes should be used:\\n\\n- MRA of chest 71555: C8909 – C8911\\n\\nAdditionally, for MRI procedures that specify \"with contrast,\" the technical component (TC) RVUs include payment for paramagnetic contrast media. It is important to ensure that the contrast media used is separately billed with the appropriate HCPCS \"Q\" code. In this case, for contrast media utilized in performing the service, the appropriate HCPCS \"Q\" code should be separately billed along with the CPT code for the imaging procedure.\\n\\nFurthermore, specific coding requirements and guidelines may apply for Medicare coverage of MRI procedures, especially when related to specific medical conditions such as lung nodules. It is crucial to adhere to the relevant coding guidelines, including the use of appropriate ICD codes to indicate the medical necessity and indication for the MRI procedure.\\n\\nTherefore, when submitting pre-authorization claims for MRI of the chest with contrast related to lung nodules, ensure that the correct HCPCS and CPT codes are used, and the medical documentation supports the medical necessity for the procedure based on the specific clinical indication.
